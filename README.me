#This project setup provides a comprehensive structure and implementation for a Python-#based Streamlit application that integrates with Azure OpenAI and Langchain to do an #Automated contract review
#Provisioning Azure resources such as Azure OpenAI Service, Blob Storage, and other #necessary services can be done using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or Azure Resource #Manager (ARM) templates. Below, I'll guide you through provisioning these resources #using the Azure CLI, which is a powerful and scriptable way to manage Azure resources.
##### 1. Install Azure CLI
#If you haven't already installed Azure CLI, follow the installation guide for your operating #system.
brew update && brew install azure-cli
##### 2. Log in to Azure
# First, you need to log in to your Azure account:
az login
#This will open a browser window for you to authenticate. After logging in, you'll be #returned to the CLI.
##### 3. Set the Default Subscription (Optional)
#If you have multiple subscriptions, set the default subscription where you want to create #the resources:
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
#You can list your subscriptions to find the correct one:
az account list --output table
##### 4. Provision an Azure Resource Group
#A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
#Replace myResourceGroup with the name you want for your resource group and eastus #with the Azure region closest to you or where your services should be deployed.
###### 5. Provision Azure Blob Storage
# Azure Blob Storage is used to store unstructured data like text, binary data, etc.
az storage account create \
  --name mystorageaccount12345 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --location eastus \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --kind StorageV2
# Replace mystorageaccount12345 with a unique name for your storage account.
# After creating the storage account, create a blob container to store your files:
az storage container create \
  --name myblobcontainer \
  --account-name mystorageaccount12345
# Replace myblobcontainer with the name you want for your blob container.
##### 6. Provision Azure OpenAI Service
# Azure OpenAI Service provides access to OpenAI's models, including GPT, in Azure.
1.	### Register the Provider (if not already registered):
#Before you can create Azure OpenAI resources, you must register the OpenAI resource provider in your subscription:
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
2.	##### Create an Azure OpenAI Service Resource:
az cognitiveservices account create \
  --name myOpenAIService \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --kind OpenAI \
  --sku S0 \
  --location eastus \
  --yes
o	--name: The name of your Azure OpenAI service.
o	--kind: Must be set to OpenAI.
o	--sku: Pricing tier; S0 is a common choice for development.
o	--location: The region where the service is deployed.
##### 7. Provision an Azure App Service for Web Apps (Optional)
#If you're planning to deploy a web application, you might need an Azure App Service.
1.	### Create an App Service Plan:
az appservice plan create \
  --name myAppServicePlan \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --sku B1 \
  --is-linux
o	--sku B1: This specifies the pricing tier. Adjust based on your requirements.
o	--is-linux: Specifies that the app service plan is for Linux.
2.	### Create the Web App:
az webapp create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --plan myAppServicePlan \
  --name myWebApp12345 \
  --runtime "PYTHON|3.9"
o	# Replace myWebApp12345 with a unique name for your web app.
##### 8. Retrieve and Manage Connection Strings and Keys
#For services like Blob Storage or Azure OpenAI, you may need to retrieve connection #strings or keys.
1.	## For Blob Storage:
az storage account show-connection-string \
  --name mystorageaccount12345 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup
# This will return the connection string needed to connect to your Blob Storage.
2.	## For Azure OpenAI Service:
az cognitiveservices account keys list \
  --name myOpenAIService \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup
# This will return the keys for your Azure OpenAI Service.
##### 9. Verify the Resources in the Azure Portal
#You can go to the Azure Portal and navigate to your resource group to verify that all the #resources have been successfully created.
##### 10. Automating with ARM Templates (Optional)
#If you prefer to automate the creation of these resources with an ARM template, you can #define all these resources in a JSON template and deploy it using the Azure CLI:
az deployment group create --resource-group myResourceGroup --template-file azuredeploy.json
#Your azuredeploy.json would define the storage account, OpenAI service, and other #resources in a single template.
#You've now provisioned several key Azure resources, including Azure Blob Storage, Azure #OpenAI Service, and an optional App Service for deploying web applications. These #resources can now be used as part of your broader application architecture in Azure. You #can manage these resources using the Azure CLI, Azure Portal, or automated deployment #tools like ARM templates or Terraform.
########################## Setting Up the Development Environment #############
#Setting up a development environment with Python and the necessary libraries like azure-#openai, langchain, streamlit, and others involves several steps. Here's how you can do #it:
##### 1. Install Python
#Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install the latest #version of Python from the official Python website.
#####2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
#It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This keeps your #project dependencies isolated and helps avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
1.	# Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv myenv
# Replace myenv with the name of your virtual environment.
2.	# Activate the Virtual Environment:
o	On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
o	On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
3.	#After activation, you should see the virtual environment’s name in your terminal #prompt.
3. Install Required Python Libraries
With the virtual environment activated, you can install the required Python libraries.
1.	#Upgrade pip:
#Ensure you have the latest version of pip:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2.	#Install Libraries:
#Use pip to install the necessary libraries. Here's how to install azure-openai, #langchain, streamlit, and other commonly used libraries:
pip install azure-openai langchain streamlit
#You might also need additional libraries depending on your project, such as numpy, #pandas, or requests:
pip install numpy pandas requests
3.	# Generate a requirements.txt File (Optional):
#If you want to share your environment setup with others or deploy it, you can #generate a requirements.txt file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
#This file can later be used to install all the dependencies with a single command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. ###### Create a Simple Streamlit App Using Azure OpenAI and Langchain
# Replace the placeholders with your Azure OpenAI API key and deployment details.
6. # Running the Streamlit App
#Once everything is set up, you can run your Streamlit app using the following command:
streamlit run app.py
#This will start a local development server, and you can access your app by visiting #http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.
######### OR if you are starting by cloning the repo, this are the set up ###### instructions on how you do a Streamlit Azure OpenAI Integration


1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
2.	#Set up the virtual environment:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
3.	#Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.	#Configure environment variables:
o	#Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai-endpoint.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name
5.	# Run the application:
streamlit run app.py
